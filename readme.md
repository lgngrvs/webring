# [Architects] webring

Hi! Welcome to the [Architects] webring.

The [Architects] webring connects a community of people who are curious, smart, and motivated to change the world — in small ways and in big ways. If this sounds like you, it's designed for you. Keep reading.

The webring connects the personal sites of its members into a "ring" of blogs, facilitating connections and longer-form exchange between them. The community itself is a goal — and also, by connecting everyone together like this, we make it easy for new members — especially people who might not have access to a community like this otherwise — to find other capable, interesting people. 

*Caveat: don't worry about whether you're interesting enough yet. Everyone starts somewhere. Interesting people tend to become that way when surrounded by others who push them forward.*

## Get started

To get started, (open a pull request to update `ring.json` with your website's information, OR fill out [this form](https://forms.gle/7HMFzwRjA1tAczK16) to request to be added if you don't use git/github), and then ping me `@lgngrvs` on Discord.

Once your site is entered into `ring.json`, you can officially join the webring. All you need to do is add links to your site with the url as follows, substituting <url> for your site's url (without the URL scheme, i.e. remove the `https://`): 

`<a href="<THIS WEBRING'S URL>/next/<YOUR SITE'S URL>">Next in webring</a>`

`<a href="<THIS WEBRING'S URL>/prev/<YOUR SITE'S URL>">Previous in webring</a>`

You can visit `<THIS WEBRING'S URL>/component/<YOUR SITE'S URL>` for a preformatted, easy copy-paste `<div>` element you can use as well (recommended).
