Ok, how do I actually make this? 
- generate everything serverside (requires hosting :| )
- generate things clientside (requires js :| )


Ok, here's how I'm going to do it. 

flask app.py


fuck it, i'm making a flask app and i'll figure everything else out later. 

- membersites.json holds the members list
- flask: serves a demo. 
ok, how do you decide what embed to use?

Instead of the iframe, we give a defailt template. 

we send a request to the main server with the hostname embedded.
